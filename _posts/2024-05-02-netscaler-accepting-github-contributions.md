As part of a new Cloud Software Group initiative, NetScaler is welcoming community contributions to its open source projects on GitHub. Since the release of the NetScaler Ansible Collection, we have continually received requests to accept contributions. Today I was excited to share that we are accepting contributions to this project, which will help providing automated NetScaler workflows to help IT teams deploy applications faster.

## NetScaler and Red Hat Ansible for network automation

NetScaler and Red Hat Ansible seamlessly integrate to provide network automation for Day 0 â€“ N operations for faster application deployment. Using simple declarative language, Red Hat Ansible orchestrates processes through playbooks executed on its automation engine and communicates with NetScaler application delivery controllers (ADCs) via its REST API without necessitating additional software or agents.

The NetScaler Ansible Collection provides declarative Ansible modules to configure and manage NetScaler ADCs. By automating the provisioning and configuration of NetScaler ADCs, Red Hat Ansible enables faster application deployment.

## Why contributions matter?

> Contributing to open source projects is not only beneficial for individual growth and skill development, but also plays a vital role in advancing technology, fostering collaboration between organizations, and creating a more inclusive and accessible software ecosystem.

- Contributions help shaping the future of an ecosystem. Ideas, expertise, and creativity help enhancing solutions.
- Collaborative contributions enable faster iterations, introducing new features, and delivering improvements to any feature or product that benefits the entire community.
- Engaging with like-minded developers, sharing knowledge, and expanding skills through meaningful contributions and interactions.
