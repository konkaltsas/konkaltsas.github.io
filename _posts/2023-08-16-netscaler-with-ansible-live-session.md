In this NetScaler Community live session we talked about:
- The new NetScaler Ansible Collection and new updated
- Talked about the Ansible fundamentals and the anatomy of a PlayBook
- Focused on best practicies and how it can make configuration management easier. 
- Then, we did a hands-on demo where we discussed content swithing and load balancing configuration  and how to migrate to the new collection

>Use `Ansible` for `NetDevOps` by applying DevOps and/or continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices to networking activities.
