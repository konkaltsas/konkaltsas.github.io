During this "NetScaler live" session we talked about the new NetScaler Ansible Collection and introduced some cool new features.  

- We started with some Ansible fundamentals and the anatomy of a PlayBook
- Then we focused on best practicies and how it can make configuration management easier. 
- Finally, we did a hands-on demo using the collection. We covered content swithing and load balancing and how to migrate from the old collection to the new one.

>Use `Ansible` for `NetDevOps` by applying DevOps and/or continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices to networking activities.
