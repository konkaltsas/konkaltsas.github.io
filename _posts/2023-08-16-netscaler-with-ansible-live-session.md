During this "NetScaler live" session I talked about the importance of Continuous Configuration Automation (CCA) tools and how NetScaler Ansible Collection can be used to manage Application Delivery and Security configuration. I started by introducing the new NetScaler Ansible Collection and then we covered some cool new features.  

- Ansible fundamentals and the anatomy of a PlayBook
- Best practicies and how can make configuration management easier. 
- Finally, a hands-on demo using the collection. We covered content swithing and load balancing and how to migrate from the old collection to the new one.
