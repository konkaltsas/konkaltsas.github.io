Automating infrastructure deployments and configurations helps streamlining the process of building, testing, and deploying infrastructure leading to a secure, scalable and reliable infrastructure.

During this "NetScaler live" session we focused on:

- How you can leverage Terraform Cloud to Automate NetScaler operations
- How to setup a NetScaler Automation pipeline on Terraform Cloud
- How to store and retrieve credentials and manage your certificates
- How to safely store your Terraform state file
- How to segregate the duties of committing and approving Infrastructure as Code changes

> There are various ways to design `Automation` pipelines; Terraform Cloud and makes it easier for teams to collaborate especially in complex, multi-cloud, and multi-team environments.
