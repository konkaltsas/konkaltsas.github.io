title:  "Application management with NetScalerâ€™s Next Gen APIs [NetScaler Event]"
excerpt: "NetScaler Next-Gen API is a powerful modern RESTful API that allows you to programmatically configure NetScaler in a simple and intuitive way. It is based on a declarative, desired state and application-centric interface, and aims to abstract away and simplify many of the low-level complexity of traditional NetScaler configurations, making it more suitable to application developers even those who are not networking or ADC experts."

NetScaler Next-Gen API is a powerful modern RESTful API that allows you to programmatically configure NetScaler in a simple and intuitive way. It is based on a declarative, desired state and application-centric interface, and aims to abstract away and simplify many of the low-level complexity of traditional NetScaler configurations, making it more suitable to application developers even those who are not networking or ADC experts.

During this "NetScaler Live" session I had the oportunity discuss: 

- The Core Principles of Next-Gen API and The Next-Gen Config Model
- How Next-Gen API simplifies application configuration management using just a couple of APIs.
- Demonstrated how to configure simple Load Balancing & advanced Content-Switching configurations using a single Next-Gen API.
