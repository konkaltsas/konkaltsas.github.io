During this "NetScaler Connect" webinar I had the oportunity to talk about the importance of DevOps and Infrastructure as Code for Networking and how NetScaler's Automation Toolkit can help. 

- We covered the different solutions that are available as part of the toolkit
- Then we discussed a real-case hybrid global server load balancing (GSLB) use-case.
- Finally, I did a hands-on demonstration on how you can use Terraform and the different providers available to do a Hybrid Active-Active GSLB deployment on Public Cloud (Azure) and on-prem (ESXi).
