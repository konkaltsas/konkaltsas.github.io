During this "NetScaler live" session we talked about the importance of DevOps and Infrastructure as Code. Then, we focused on Terraform and how it can be used for NetScaler provisioning & configuration.

>A fundamental principle of DevOps is to treat infrastructure the same way developers treat application code. Practicing `infrastructure as code` means applying the same rigor of application code development to infrastructure provisioning. All configurations should be defined in a declarative way and stored in a source control system similar to application code. Infrastructure provisioning, orchestration and deployment should also support the use of `infrastructure as code`.
