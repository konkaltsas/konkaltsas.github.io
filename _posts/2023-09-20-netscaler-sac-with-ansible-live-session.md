During this "NetScaler live" session we focused on the Security.

- We started with why SaC is important for Shifting Security left in the early stages of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and then
- Demonstrate how Ansible can be used to configure NetScaler WAF for protecting applications.

> `Security as Code (SaC)` is a concept that leverages code and automation to enforce security policies and practices across an organization's entire infrastructure. To successfully transition from `DevOps` to the security-integrated approach of `DevSecOps` means embracing `SaC`.
