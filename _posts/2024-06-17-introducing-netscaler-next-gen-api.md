NetScaler Next-Gen API is the latest version of NetScaler’s application programming interface (API) and is now available in technical preview. A RESTful API, NetScaler Next-Gen API allows you to programmatically configure NetScaler with an intuitive application-centric interface that abstracts away many of the low-level complexities of NetScaler configurations. It uses a declarative approach to achieve desired state for hybrid- and multi-cloud application delivery. NetScaler Next-Gen API is ideal for application developers and those who are not NetScaler or networking experts. 

## An application-centric API for faster ADC configuration

To support their business growth, enterprises are modernizing their applications. Modern application architectures require advanced automation for application delivery controller (ADC) provisioning and configuration, networking, security, and observability. As a software-based platform, NetScaler provides API-driven capabilities in all of these areas to simplify modern application delivery.

NetScaler abstracts away the complexities of networking configuration for application delivery and works the same across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, empowering your organization to move faster to deliver new products and services. A simple, intuitive interface enables configuration with minimal API calls so that application teams and DevOps can focus on application development rather than application delivery configuration. The example below shows the creation of a content-switching server with just 2 API calls using NetScaler Next-Gen API compared to 28 API calls using the previous generation NetScaler NITRO API:

You don’t need to be a networking expert to use NetScaler because its declarative API automates the configuration of NetScaler ADCs for you, freeing you to focus on your applications:

- <b>No NetScaler knowledge required</b>: NetScaler Next-Gen API is a suite of declarative REST APIs for automating the configuration of NetScaler ADCs, eliminating the need for prior NetScaler experience.
- <b>Manage ADCs as code</b>: NetScaler Next-Gen API is an application-centric API that lets you manage ADC infrastructure as code — without the need to learn NetScaler commands.
- <b>Streamline operations with self-service access to NetScaler</b>: NetScaler Next-Gen API enables you to quickly configure ADC infrastructure via self-service portals like ServiceNow to deploy applications faster. 
- <b>Protect the integrity of your production environment with policy-based enforcement</b>: NetScaler Next-Gen API validates all new configurations against the running configuration, informs you if there is a conflict with your desired state, and automatically rolls back the new changes.

> Using NetScaler Next-Gen API is not just a technology choice — it’s also a decision to drive business growth through automation. By using NetScaler Next-Gen API to gain efficiency, reliability, and scalability, you simplify application delivery and security to consistently deliver an optimal application experience to your customers.
