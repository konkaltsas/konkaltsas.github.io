During this "NetScaler Connect" webinar I had the oportunity to present how you can maximise Infrastructure Automation using the new features what come with the latest version of the Terraform Provider for SVM (SDX).

- We covered why it is important for a business to achieve operational efficiency and for operations teams on their daily activities.
- Did some cool demos to see how you can do these in action.
