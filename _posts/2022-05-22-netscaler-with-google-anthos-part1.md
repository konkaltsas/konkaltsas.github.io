## Hybrid Cloud Application Delivery

There’s no single path for cloud migrations, and different requirements around areas like cloud maturity, regulation, and compliance among others will lead to different deployment models. This is where Google Anthos shines with its unified management for infrastructure and apps. Incorporating emerging cloud-native processes like GitOps and continuous configuration, which Anthos supports out of the box, gives IT teams new ways to manage infrastructure.

>Agile, flexible DevOps practices are crucial to successful digital transformation initiatives. NetScaler is investing to provide all the tools DevOps, CloudOps and SecOps teams need to lead digital transformations, cloud migration, and app modernization.

In this series of blog posts, we’ll look at how you can use NetScaler with Google Anthos to provide consistent and reliable app delivery and security for hybrid and multi-cloud workloads by applying enterprise cloud-native principles.

NetScalers can be combined in powerful and flexible topologies that complement organizational boundaries. Dual-tier deployments employ high-capacity hardware or virtualized NetScalers in the first tier to segment control between network operators and Kubernetes operators, while the second tier is within the Kubernetes cluster (using container-based NetScalers).

With its Tier-1 and Tier-2 capabilities, NetScaler can make digital transformation easier from on-premises to cloud, consistently and securely. By utilizing a single code base for all form factors, NetScaler gives you greater agility, simplicity and speed, regardless of the type of app (monolithic or microservices) and infrastructure. With key NetScaler features like autoscaling, global server load-balancing (GSLB), multi-cluster ingress, and Web App Firewall (WAF), managing hybrid and multi-cloud app delivery and security is easier.

Google Anthos unifies management of infrastructure and apps across on-premises, at the edge, and in multiple public clouds with a Google Cloud-backed control plane for consistent operation at scale. Key features like an enterprise-grade container orchestration and management service; policy and configuration management; and service mesh help you to accelerate the adoption of Day 2 operations and up-level your DevOps pipeline.

## What's next?

In our series, we’ll dive into different concepts and provide fully functional labs for the reader to test. All labs source code will be publicly available in our on GitHub. 
The topics we’ll cover will include:

- <a href="../netscaler-with-google-anthos-part2">Autoscaling NetScaler from within a GKE cluster based on user demand.</a>
- <a href="../netscaler-with-google-anthos-part3">Security and Policy Enforcement with Anthos Policy Controller and NetScaler WAF.<a/>
- <a href="../netscaler-with-google-anthos-part4">Multi-layered API protection for modern apps.</a>
