title:  "Strengthen your security controls with NetScalerâ€™s Next-Gen APIs [Video]"
excerpt: "APIs are essential for businesses not just for their operational benefits but also for enhancing security through mechanisms like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). RBAC ensures that only authorized users or systems have access to specific resources based on their roles and responsibilities, reducing the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and API abuse."

> APIs are essential for businesses not just for their operational benefits but also for enhancing security through mechanisms like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). RBAC ensures that only authorized users or systems have access to specific resources based on their roles and responsibilities, reducing the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and API abuse.

Additionally, enhancing application security by facilitating secure data exchange protocols and encryption standards enable businesses to implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

NetScaler Next-Gen API is a powerful modern RESTful API that allows you to programmatically configure NetScaler in a simple and intuitive way. By following a desired state and application-centric approach it drives operational efficiency and innovation but also strengthens cybersecurity defenses, making it an indispensable component of modern business strategies.

During this "NetScaler Live" session, I had the oportunity to discuss: 

- Role-based access to the Next Generation APIs for enforcing granular access controls at Application level
- Simplify TLS configuration and cipher suites management using an Application Centric approach.
- Demo: A walkthrough of how to configure advanced Applications by following these principles.
