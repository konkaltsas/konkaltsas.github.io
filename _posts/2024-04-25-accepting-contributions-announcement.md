> Contributing to open source projects is not only beneficial for individual growth and skill development, but also plays a vital role in advancing technology, fostering collaboration between organizations, and creating a more inclusive and accessible software ecosystem.

During this "NetScaler Live" session I had the oportunity cover some NetScaler updates and announce that NetScaler is officially accepting contributions for the Ansible Collection on GitHub. We covered:

- Why it is important for someone to consider contributing.
- What are the different ways for someone to contribute.
- What are the pre-requisites.
- Finally we went through an end-to-end demonstration of signing a CLA, forking the repository, making some changes and opening a PR.
